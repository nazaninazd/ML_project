# ML_project_Breast_cancer_Prediction
### Breast Cancer Prediction Using Logistic Regression ðŸ“Š

This project focuses on building a **Logistic Regression model** using Python's Scikit-learn library to classify breast cancer cases as either **Malignant** or **Benign**. We worked with the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** from Kaggle, cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, and then building and evaluating the classifier.

### What I Did:
- Learned to set up and work in **Google Colab** for machine learning projects.
- Explored, cleaned, and preprocessed the dataset using techniques like **Label Encoding** and **Feature Scaling**.
- Built and evaluated a simple **Logistic Regression classifier** to predict cancer types.

### How This Helped Me:
This project enhanced my understanding of:
- The **logistic regression algorithm** and its real-world applications.
- Data preprocessing and preparing datasets for machine learning.
- Model evaluation techniques to gauge classifier performance.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own learning journey! ðŸš€
